## About BIND
### Intended to reduce the hatred of elderly and ageism, prevalent in society. 
Media often target stubborn old people as a comedy, portraying them as comic foils. Why is ageing a joke? The same goes for anti-ageing products. Why is youth the standard of beauty? Hatred against ageing, and the elderly is widespread in society, although we may not be aware of it. Around the world, it is a huge problem. And it has gotten even worse in recent years. According to a report published by the UN in March 2021, rapid action is needed to implement effective anti-ageism strategies. 
Based on various experiences and papers, we thought that the "Old Normal", in which people recognize each other, establish relationships, and build bonds, is a keyword that can solve it.

### Core function: record and upload audios 
There are two kinds of users. A teller(senior), and a listener(junior). BIND allows seniors to record their own stories and juniors to listen to them so that they can feel close to each other and realize that the elderly are just people around them. As a result, we believe this app will help reduce ageism. 
Juniors can find and listen to stories, and seniors can record their own stories and see junior's reactions to it. As seniors record their stories, they will be able to look back over time and stop their hatred of old age by thinking about what time has brought to them.

### Categories of stories
Seniors can convey their various experiences and thoughts through bind. They can share family traditions, knowledge such as history, art, etc. We also added a "Slumber category" that juniors can listen to while sleeping through lullabies or tails, through a survey.

## Future plans

Also, we are considering to add a recommendation system for users.
